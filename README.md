This program contains an implementation of the famous algorithm, used to calculate the optimal order for matrix multiplication.

Given matrices orders in the format: M1's order is p1Xp2, M2's order is p2Xp3, ... , Mn's order is pnX(pn+1) -->
The program calculates and prints a string which represents the optimum order for multiplication between the given n matrices.
